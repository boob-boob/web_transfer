# web_transfer
Easy way to transfer file between your devices in a network wirelessly.

# How it works?
Think you want to transfer an image from your pc to your phone:  
Run the application with ```python web_transfer.py``` then it asks for file location(here is an image) after selecting the file, you can download the image with entering below address to your phone browser, simple as that.  
Address >> ```<your pc ip address>:11711```  

And even if you don't want to install python you can download windows exe file from [here](https://github.com/boob-boob/web_transfer/releases/download/0.0.1/web_transfer_windows.exe).

**Note**: make sure your pc firewall or antivirus allows the connection.  
in windows probably you need to disable firewall or setting ruls for it or etc.
