# web_transfer
Easy way to transfer file between your devices in a network wirelessly.

# how it works?
Think you want to transfer an image from your pc to your phone:  
Run the application with ```python web_transfer.py``` then it asks for file location(here is an image) after selecting the file, you can download the image with entering below address to your phone browser, simple as that.
Address >> ```<your pc ip address>:11711```  



**Note**: make sure your pc firewall or antivirus allows the connection.  
in windows probably you need to disable firewall or setting ruls for it or etc.
