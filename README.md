# web_transfer
Easy way to transfer files between devices(like your pc and your phone) in a network.

# how it works?
Think you want to transfer an image from your pc to your phone:  
run the application with ```python web_transfer.py``` then it asks for file location(here is an image) after selecting the file, you can download the image with entering below address to your phone browser, simple as that.

Address = ```<your pc ip address>:11711```

**Note**: make sure your pc firewall or antivirus allows devices to connect that port by disabling firewall or setting ruls for it or etc.
